### Hi there, I am Jai Batra


## I am a student with a passion for Data science/Cybersecurity. I love to create unique solutions through code and different technologies.

- I’m interested in Data science and Cybersecurity
- I’m currently learning C, C++, and Python
- I’m eager to learn something new and work through different environments
- Fun fact: Love to game and find new ways to figure out certain scenarios
