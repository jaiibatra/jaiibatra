<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jai Batra</h1>


## Ever since I started learning programming, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how technology can solve complex problems. This passion has guided my studies at the University of Illinois Chicago, where Iâ€™ve focused on Computer Science with interest in Data Science and Cybersecurity. I thrive on creating innovative solutions through coding and exploring the potential of new technologies. 

- Iâ€™m interested in Data science and Cybersecurity
- Iâ€™m currently learning C, C++, and Python
- Iâ€™m eager to learn something new and work through different environments
- Fun fact: Iâ€™m a gaming enthusiast who loves strategizing and solving complex scenarios!
